== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= I'm trying to install the plugin, I'm looking for boost online sales plugin but I can not find it = 
When looking for a plugin in WordPress, the display criteria are set by WordPress and not by the developer. In this case just switch for 'author' instead of keyword, and type ccrd. 

As WordPress index is something I don't know how to work, I recommend looking for author (ccrd) or download the plugin for WordPress web site, then install.

= What do I do after installing Boost Online Sales? =
Just go to the settings menu and play with the desire fields.
